This repository features JavaScript code designed to create and display a set of blog cards on a webpage. Each card showcases a blog post or article, complete with an image, title, description, and a link to read more.

The project also includes a basic pagination system that updates the active page indicator as users interact with page selectors.

Hereâ€™s what this project covers:
Dynamically generating card elements from a dataset.
Rendering these cards into a designated container on the page.
Adding a simple pagination system to manage and highlight the current page.
